# The Statesman
A Wordpress theme for The Statesman â€” Stony Brook University's oldest student newspaper.

## Setup
After installing WordPress, use the import tool to upload the xml file in the main directory. This file contains sample posts from sbstatesman.com with the categories and tags used by the template. No featured images are included in the xml file, but you can the [Quick Featured Images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-featured-images/) plugin to set a placeholder. The default-feature-image.png file in the images directory works well for this.

The template links to two pages, "About" and "Police Blotter." You will need to create these pages manually for the links to work. You can use the page-blotter.php template for the "Police Blotter" page.
